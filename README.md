# XOutput

XOutput is a software that can convert DirectInput into XInput. DirectInput data is read and sent to a virtual XInput (Xbox 360 Controller) device. XInput is the new standard game controller input on windows, and DirectInput can no longer be used with Universal Windows Platform softwares, but with this tool you can use DirectInput devices as well. 

To use the software you need to:
* Install Microsoft .NET 4.0 (or newer)
* Install Visual C++ 2013 (or newer)
* Install official Xbox 360 Controller driver
* Download and install [ScpToolkit](https://github.com/nefarius/ScpServer/releases/latest)
* Download the [latest release](https://github.com/csutorasa/XOutput/releases/latest) with SlimDX.dll included
* Connect your DirectInput device
* Set your mappings and save the settings
* Start the emulation
